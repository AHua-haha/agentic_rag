      "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise as highly capable AI assistants that excel in complex reasoning tasks requiring expert knowledge across a wide range of fields, including in specialized domains such as programming and creative writing. They enable interaction with humans",
      "through intuitive chat interfaces, which has led to rapid and widespread adoption among the general public.",
      "The capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training methodology. Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data, followed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement",
      "Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have limited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs (such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon",
      "(Penedo et al., 2023)) that match the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed \"product\" LLMs, such as ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are",
      "heavily fine-tuned to align with human preferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in compute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within the community to advance AI alignment",

      "In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs,  $LLAMA$  2 and  $LLAMA$  2-CHAT, at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,  $LLAMA$  2-CHAT models generally perform better than existing open-source",
      "models. They also appear to be on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see Figures 1 and 3). We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-specific data annotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and",

      "Furthermore, our initial version of LlAMA 2-CHAT predominantly concentrated on English-language data. While our experimental observations suggest the model has garnered some proficiency in other languages, its proficiency is limited, due primarily to the limited amount of pretraining data available",
      "in non-English languages (as documented in Table 10). Consequently, the model's performance in languages other than English remains fragile and should be used with caution.",
      "Like other LLMs,  $\\text{LLAMA 2}$  may generate harmful, offensive, or biased content due to its training on publicly available online datasets. We attempted to mitigate this via fine-tuning, but some issues may remain, particularly for languages other than English where publicly available",
      "datasets were not available. We will continue to fine-tune and release updated versions in the future as we progress on addressing these issues.",
      "Not everyone who uses AI models has good intentions, and conversational AI agents could potentially be used for nefarious purposes such as generating misinformation or retrieving information about topics like bioterrorism or cybercrime. We have, however, made efforts to tune the models to avoid",
      "these topics and diminish any capabilities they might have offered for those use cases.",
      "While we attempted to reasonably balance safety with helpfulness, in some instances, our safety tuning goes too far. Users of LLAMA 2-CHAT may observe an overly cautious approach, with the model erring on the side of declining certain requests or responding with too many safety details.",

      "Large Language Models. The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the field of LLMs. Following the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B parameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or",
      "specialized models, e.g. Galactica, for science (Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in this progression is the rise of Llama, recognized for its focus on",
      "computational efficiency during inference (Touvron et al., 2023). A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closed-source models. Open-source releases like BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), OPT(Zhang et al., 2022), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023) have risen to challenge",
      "their closed-source counterparts like GPT-3 and Chinchilla.",
      "Yet, when it comes to the \"production-ready\" LLMs such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, there's a marked distinction in performance and usability. These models rely on intricate tuning techniques to align with human preferences (Gudibandé et al., 2023), a process that is still being explored and",
      "refined within the open-source community.",
      "Attempts to close this gap have emerged, with distillation-based models such as Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) and Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) adopting a unique approach to training with synthetic instructions (Honovich et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). However, while these models show promise, they",
      "still fall short of the bar set by their closed-source counterparts.",
      "Instruction Tuning. Wei et al. (2021) obtained zero-shot performance on unseen tasks by fine-tuning LLMs on numerous datasets. Chung et al. (2022) and Longpre et al. (2023) investigate the impact of instruction tuning as a function of number of tasks, model size, prompt settings, etc. Prompts used",
      "for instruction tuning can be created by humans or by LLMs themselves (Zhou et al., 2022), and follow-up instructions can be used to refine initial generations to make them more useful, engaging, and unbiased (Ganguli et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023). An approach related to instruction tuning is",
      "chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022b), in which models are prompted to explain their reasoning when given a complex problem, in order to increase the likelihood that their final answer is correct.",
      "RLHF has emerged as a powerful strategy for fine-tuning Large Language Models, enabling significant improvements in their performance (Christiano et al., 2017). The method, first showcased by Stiannon et al. (2020) in the context of text-summarization tasks, has since been extended to a range of",
      "other applications. In this paradigm, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the models' responses more closely with human expectations and preferences.",
      "Ouyang et al. (2022) demonstrates that a combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix issues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. Bai et al. (2022b) partially automates this fine-tuning-plus-RLHF approach by replacing the",
      "human-labeled fine-tuning data with the model's own self-critiques and revisions, and by replacing human raters with a model when ranking model outputs in RLHF, a process known as \"RL from AI Feedback\" (RLAIF).",
      "Known LLM Safety Challenges. Recent literature has extensively explored the risks and challenges linked with Large Language Models. Bender et al. (2021b) and Weidinger et al. (2021) underscore various hazards like bias, toxicity, private data leakage, and the potential for malicious uses. Solaiman",
      "et al. (2023) categorizes these impacts into two groups — those that can be assessed within the base system and those requiring a societal context evaluation, while Kumar et al. (2022) offers potential mitigation strategies to curb harm. Work from Roller et al. (2020) and Dinan et al. (2021) also",
      "illuminates the difficulties tied to chatbot-oriented LLMs, with concerns ranging from privacy to misleading expertise claims. Deng et al. (2023) proposes a taxonomic framework to tackle these issues, and Bergman et al. (2022) delves into the balance between potential positive and negative impacts",
      "from releasing dialogue models.",
      "Investigations into red teaming reveal specific challenges in tuned LLMs, with studies by Ganguli et al. (2022) and Zhuo et al. (2023) showcasing a variety of successful attack types and their effects on the generation of harmful content. National security agencies and various researchers, such as",
      "(Mialon et al., 2023), have also raised red flags around advanced emergent model behaviors, cyber threats, and potential misuse in areas like biological warfare. Lastly, broader societal issues like job displacement due to accelerated AI research and an over-reliance on LLMs leading to training",
      "data degradation are also pertinent considerations (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018; Autor and Salomons, 2018; Webb, 2019; Shumailov et al., 2023). We are committed to continuing our work engaging with the broader policy, academic, and industry community on these issues."

      "Context Length. We expand the context window for  $\\text{LLAMA}^2$  from 2048 tokens to 4096 tokens. The longer context window enables models to process more information, which is particularly useful for supporting longer histories in chat applications, various summarization tasks, and",
      "understanding longer documents. Table 16 compares the performance of 2k and 4k context pretraining on long-context benchmarks. Both models are trained for 150B tokens, keeping the same architecture and hyperparameters as a baseline, varying only the context length. We observe improvement on SCROLLS",
      "(Shaham et al., 2022), where the average input length is 3.5k, and no performance degradation on SQUAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2018). Table 17 shows that the longer context model retains strong performance on various general-purpose tasks.",
      "Grouped-Query Attention. A standard practice for autoregressive decoding is to cache the key (K) and value (V) pairs for the previous tokens in the sequence, speeding up attention computation. With increasing context windows or batch sizes, however, the memory costs associated with the KV cache",
      "size in multi-head attention (MHA) models grow significantly. For larger models, where KV cache size becomes a bottleneck, key and value projections can be shared across multiple heads without much degradation of performance (Chowdhery et al., 2022). Either the original multi-query format with a",
      "single KV projection (MQA, Shazeer, 2019) or a grouped-query attention variant with 8 KV projections (GQA, Ainslie et al., 2023) can be used.",
      "In Table 18, we compare MQA and GQA variants with an MHA baseline. We train all models with 150B tokens while keeping a fixed 30B model size. To keep a similar overall parameter count across GQA and MQA, we increase the dimension of the feed-forward layers to compensate for the reduction in the",
      "attention layers. For the MQA variant, we increase the FFN dimension by a factor of 1.33, and for the GQA variant, we increase it by a factor of 1.3. From the results, we observe that the GQA variant performs comparably to the MHA baseline on most evaluation tasks and is better than the MQA variant",
      "on average.",
      "To optimize for latency, we host our largest models using 8 A100s in a single node with tensor parallelism (Shoeybi et al., 2019). In this setting, sharding for MQA cannot be done across heads anymore, given the number of heads is lower than the number of GPUs. Either you duplicate the KV values in",
      "all GPUs (making the KV cache size equal to GQA), or an alternative is to shard across the batch dimension instead (Pope et al., 2022).

    "chunks": [
      "With the increasing scale of publicly available training data, it has become inevitable that some portion of evaluation data is seen during training, and may provide an undue boost in evaluation performance.",
      "Earlier work (Brown et al. (2020), Wei et al. (2022a), Du et al. (2022) in measuring such dataset contamination considered an example from an evaluation set to be \"contaminated\" if there existed a collision between a high-order  $n$ -gram (generally,  $n = 13$ ) from the sample and the training",
      "data. This was a deliberately conservative approach in order to produce a \"clean\" subset of the data with high precision, and is used in open-sourced evaluation libraries (e.g. Gao et al. (2021)).",
      "This approach, however, was unable to detect precisely what proportion of a given sample is contaminated, and didn't take into account how evaluation datasets are constructed. Furthermore, as noted in Chowdhery et al. (2022), some datasets (such as BoolQ) contain contexts extracted verbatim from",
      "the web, but not the question and answer continuation. As such, highly contaminated samples from these datasets are unlikely to gain an unfair advantage. The methodology in Chowdhery et al. (2022) further improves on the earlier  $n$ -gram collision detection by considering a sample to be",
      "contaminated if 70% of all 8-grams can be found at least once in the training data.",
      "The previous methodologies noted above all consider contamination in text space, and don't appear to consider the formatting of prompts used for actual evaluation. In contrast, we instead match on tokenized input, being careful to pass fully verbalized evaluation samples to the tokenizer. We also",
      "diverge from the previous methodologies by considering contamination from a bottom-up perspective. We consider a token to be contaminated if it appears in any token  $n$ -gram longer than 10 tokens in both the evaluation sample and the training set, and define the contamination percentage of a",
      "sample to be the percentage of tokens contaminated. This allows us to view the benchmark performance of our models on a range of contamination scales, while retaining the ability to test a high-precision clean subset (samples with  $< 20\\%$  contamination) and a high-precision contaminated subset",
      "(samples with  $> 80\\%$  contamination). In order to account for the vagaries of the precise format of verbalized samples, we allow a small \"skipgram budget\" of four tokens, so that matched spans between an evaluation sample and the training data can differ in at most four positions (we do not",
      "allow trailing mismatches, or mismatches in the first 10 tokens).",
      "We identify such  $10(+)$ -skipgrams with suffix arrays implemented using a variation of the library from Lee et al. (2022), modified to work on a PySpark cluster (effectively without random access to disk). Given the embarrassingly parallel nature of the task, we are able to find all such 10-grams",
      "(and their full lengths) in our entire dataset in around seven hours (including time to tokenize), utilizing an estimated 1,500 cores.",
      "As there are many confounding factors at play when determining whether dataset contamination has contributed to evaluation performance (mostly stemming from the fact that \"clean\" and \"dirty\" subsets do not necessarily well-estimate the population distribution), we make the following assumption: In",
      "the event of dataset contamination contributing to evaluation performance, we expect both the \"cleanest\" examples to have an overall worse average score than their complement, and the \"dirtiest\" samples to have an overall better average score than their complement.
